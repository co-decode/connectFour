# To Do
_This is a demonstration of NextJS, Typescript, Socket.io_
Right now I only have an input box that changes on every connected client when any client types into it.

I want to change this into a comment system... I can just drag and drop some text from previous examples, but I think I want to do this for myself from here.

I eventually want to get Jest into the mix here, but I will leave it out until I start working on the connect four game.
I will work on the game after I get this Chat app working.

I will have to work out how matchmaking and rooms work... but we'll deal with that when we get there.

From here, this is what needs to happen:
1. I should read the 'http' and 'net' docs.
2. I should modify client.tsx to get the chat app working.
3. I should work out how the rooms work, and get the chat app working with it.
4. I should then transition to building the connect four game.
5. I should be writing tests for as much as I can in this process.
6. Might be cool to keep the chat room function in there too.
